# Snobal workflow

### This is an example workflow for running the one dimensional implementation of Snobal. It includes notebooks and methods for creating the necessary model inputs from time-series station data.

### _Station_pipeline_ module includes several methods for approximating long wave radiation, as well as temperature-based partitioning of precipitation phase and density.

### _Irwin_pipeline_ notebook includes steps to transform station data including time adjustments, interpolating small gaps, and other minor Q/C to conform the station data to the model specifications.

### _model_results_Irwin_ notebook reads and assigns headers to the Snobal output file, and includes plotting steps.
